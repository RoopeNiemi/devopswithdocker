docker build -t basefront .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 basefront

Not sure if it is a Windows thing, but I had problems connecting to localhost:5000, I had to directly
connect to the <docker-machine ip>:5000 on browser to access the site. The docker image is built from ubuntu:16.04
and my home pc is Windows.
